 * 0x47b710/0x47b720). Normal failures preserve the previous custom_gif.gif bytes,
 * custom row and selection. Failure of restoration or player compensation returns
 * CUSTOM_GIF_RESTORE. There is no restart recovery; power loss between the swap
 * and COMMIT may leave the new GIF unselected (owner decision 70).
 * Blocks (SD copy, fsync, database busy wait up to 3 s): call it from a worker
 * thread. One apply at a time. Precondition shared with custom_saver_db_install: the caller keeps stock's own
 * theme-selection writer out for the duration. The built-in trial decode uses LVGL's allocator and lv_fs, so it
 * must run in LVGL's context; a worker thread passes a decode hook that runs on the UI thread instead. */

 * timer calls custom_still_tick(), the UI reads the outcome with custom_still_poll(). Both run on the UI thread
 * (the LVGL image cache is dropped there); the database and decode work runs on a short-lived worker thread.
 * Stock accepts jpg/jpeg/png/bmp (any case) with no size check. diskOS adds a limit on what it hands the player,
 * whose memory is unknown (120 MB machine, about 64 MB available): at most 16 MiB and 8 million pixels
 * (unverified on the Disc; a larger image would be decoded at 3-4 bytes per pixel inside mq_player, and
 * losing that process reboots the device). Start refuses with BUSY/CONVERSION while a GIF or still apply, an unreleased conversion
 * or an unresolved conversion is outstanding. Success needs a810 success AND an output PNG that decodes (at most
 * 2 MiB and 1024x1024); only then is the row (TYPE 200) updated and the image cache dropped. Every other
 * confirmed outcome restores the previous PNG and sends one compensating pathless 0810 for the previous style.
 * No a810 before the deadline (IPC_CONV_TIMEOUT_MS) is UNRESOLVED: nothing is restored and everything stays
 * blocked until a same-generation a810 confirms completion. A queue generation
 * change alone leaves the operation unresolved because it does not prove the
 * old converter stopped writing. */
