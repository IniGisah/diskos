 * Every user action is wired with ui_on(), which names it (e.g. "np.fav") and says how essential it is. Themes may
 * rearrange a screen, but every CORE action must stay on its screen and every REACHABLE action must stay somewhere;
 * DECORATIVE things may be dropped. The host tests (tests/host) compare the named actions of every theme against
 * Default's, so a theme cannot lose a control without failing the gate.
 *
 * Components are built through the active theme's kit (theme_kit()). A theme overrides the builders it changes; any
 * builder it leaves NULL falls back to Default's, which is the UI's original code. */
