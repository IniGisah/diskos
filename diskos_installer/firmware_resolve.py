"""Install/restore orchestration for firmware acquisition (no GUI, never flashes).

The user says which firmware the Disc runs; this layer turns that into a verified
ZIP (cache, supervised download, or a manually chosen file), decides whether a
restore can use the saved backup, and checks disk space before any build starts.
Nothing here imports the flash writer, writes the backup store or moves the
current-generation pointer: those stay with service.py and its commit conditions.

Seams (`catalogue`, `supervisor`) default to the real slice 1 and slice 4
modules; tests pass fakes. Acquisition errors are never wrapped: they surface
unchanged from supervisor.start() or Acquisition.wait().
