# diskOS UI dev workflow

How to build, deploy, and iterate on the diskOS UI (`mq_ui`) on real hardware. For iterating on
UI changes you do **not** need the installer or a reflash. Build, push over SSH, hot-reload. A reboot
restores the selected signed update or flashed build.

## 1. Build the binary

Use the pinned Docker builder (Linux and macOS, Intel or Apple Silicon):

```sh
cd ui
docker build -t diskos-ui-builder .
docker run --rm -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -v "$PWD:/src" diskos-ui-builder
```

This produces a static `mq_ui` for `mipsel-linux-musl`. LVGL is vendored, so nothing else is needed.
See [`ui/README.md`](../ui/README.md) for the toolchain details and a from-scratch (non-Docker) build.

## 2. Get a shell on the device

Enable **Debug Mode** on the device (Settings -> System). It shows the device IP and a one-time SSH
password. The password is regenerated on every enable and SSH access does **not** survive a reboot.

```sh
ssh root@<device-ip>      # password from Debug Mode
```

## 3. Push the binary

Stream the freshly built `mq_ui` to a staging path, verify it, then move it into place:

```sh
ssh root@<device-ip> 'cat > /usr/data/mq_ui.new && chmod 755 /usr/data/mq_ui.new && md5sum /usr/data/mq_ui.new' < mq_ui
md5sum mq_ui
# confirm the md5 matches your local build, then:
ssh root@<device-ip> 'mv /usr/data/mq_ui.new /usr/data/mq_ui'
```

S97 checks the manifest at boot. For a manual preview, leave the manifest in place
and launch the binary directly as shown below.

## 4. Hot-reload (the important part)

This is where most people get bitten. `fiio_init.sh` runs a watchdog that does `pgrep -x mq_ui`, and
busybox `pgrep -x` matches the full `argv[0]`, not the process `comm`. If you kill `mq_ui` and do not
immediately relaunch a **detached** replacement, the watchdog respawns the **stock**
`/usr/bin/mq_ui`. That is the "it fell back to the stock FiiO UI" you may have seen.

Two rules:

### Never kill `mq_player`

`mq_player` is the stock audio engine. Killing it frees the SD card, and the hardware MCU reboots the
whole device (about 10 seconds). Only ever touch `mq_ui`. If a restart caused a full reboot rather than
just the stock UI appearing, an errant `mq_player` kill is the usual cause.

### Relaunch detached, from `/usr/data`, in one step

```sh
killall -9 mq_ui; setsid /usr/data/mq_ui </dev/null >/usr/data/diskos_boot.log 2>&1 &
```

The `setsid </dev/null` is what matters. Without it the new process is a child of your SSH session and
dies when the session closes, so the watchdog wins the race and respawns stock. Then confirm your build
(not stock) is the one running:

```sh
for p in $(pidof mq_ui); do
  [ "$(readlink /proc/$p/exe)" = /usr/bin/mq_ui ] && kill -9 $p    # prune only a stock instance
done
for p in $(pidof mq_ui); do readlink /proc/$p/exe; done    # should print /usr/data/mq_ui
```

The binary built from this source already normalizes its own `argv[0]` to bare `mq_ui`, so once it is
relaunched from `/usr/data/mq_ui` the watchdog is satisfied and leaves it alone.

The snippet above is the quick manual form; it prunes stock right away and relies on the watchdog to
recover if your build does not start. For scripted use prefer [`../tools/diskos-deploy.sh`](../tools/diskos-deploy.sh),
which includes stream upload progress (via `pv`), remote MD5 integrity verification before hot swap,
and polls until your build is confirmed running before pruning stock.

To capture the live screen or inject touch gestures during development, use [`../tools/diskos-shot.sh`](../tools/diskos-shot.sh)
and [`../tools/diskos-touch.sh`](../tools/diskos-touch.sh).

To go back to stock without a reboot, just `killall mq_ui` and let the watchdog respawn the stock UI.

## 5. Make it permanent (optional)

Hand-deployed binaries revert to the selected signed update or flashed build on reboot
(S97 checks `/usr/data/mq_ui` against that build's manifest). To bake a build in permanently:

### Option A: Wi-Fi OTA Update (No USB reflash)
Generate your custom ECDSA signing keypair and push the signed binary directly over Wi-Fi:
```sh
./tools/diskos-ota-keygen.sh
DISKOS_IP=<ip> DISKOS_PW=<pw> ./tools/diskos-ota-push.sh ui/mq_ui --reboot
```

### Option B: Mask-ROM USB Installer
Flash your custom UI with the installer:
```sh
./diskos-installer install --firmware SNOWSKY_DISC_update_*.zip --ui path/to/mq_ui --variant public
```

`--ui` overrides the bundled UI binary, so you can flash your own build. This is a mask-ROM write and
takes about 20 minutes. The installer prompts for confirmation before it writes; add `-y` only when you
deliberately want to skip that prompt (for example in a script), since it rewrites the root filesystem.

### macOS note

The installer prefers host-native tools under `vendor/<host-tag>/` (for example
`vendor/macos-arm64/`). `usbboot` must be bundled; missing squashfs tools can fall back
to `PATH`. An Apple Silicon release package includes the native tools. For a source
checkout or an Intel Mac, populate the native tools from the repository root:

```sh
./vendor/setup-macos.sh
```

It compiles `usbboot`, copies Homebrew `mksquashfs` and `unsquashfs`, bundles their dylibs,
and copies the device blobs into `vendor/macos-<arch>/` (`arm64` or `x86_64`). It requires
Xcode command line tools and Homebrew packages libusb, squashfs, lzo, lz4, xz, zstd,
pkg-config, and dylibbundler. The script requires specific versions of the native
libraries and squashfs tools. Release packages include the native
tools; see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for runtime requirements.

## Notes

- **Screenshots:** [diskos-shot.sh](../tools/diskos-shot.sh) captures the first framebuffer page
  (360x360, 32bpp BGRA) and rotates it 180 degrees. See the
  [capture limitation](../tools/README.md#screenshot). `ui/fbshot.c` is a separate helper that
  follows the active page; it is not bundled by the installer.
- **Player logs:** `/usr/data/fiio/log/fiio_player.log`. **PCM state:**
  `/proc/asound/card*/pcm*p/sub*/status` (`RUNNING` = active PCM stream).
- **Raw player frames:** a sender such as `psend` must be installed separately; it is not bundled.

## Preview a UI build without reflashing

A live preview is temporary. Build `mq_ui` as above, keep the Disc and computer on the same Wi-Fi network, and enable Debug Mode under Settings > System. The screen shows the Disc IP and a fresh SSH password. You may enter it interactively; `sshpass` is optional.

From the folder holding `mq_ui`, stream it to a staging path and compare the two MD5 hashes before replacing the running UI:

```sh
ssh root@<device-ip> 'cat > /usr/data/mq_ui.new && chmod 755 /usr/data/mq_ui.new && md5sum /usr/data/mq_ui.new' < mq_ui
md5sum mq_ui
ssh root@<device-ip> 'mv /usr/data/mq_ui.new /usr/data/mq_ui'
```

Run the detached reload command in section 4, then check `/proc/<pid>/exe` as shown there. The startup animation runs again. Restarting the Disc restores the selected signed update or flashed build because the boot script checks the UI against its manifest. To keep a build across restarts, flash it with the installer as in section 5.
